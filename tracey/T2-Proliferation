\subsection{Growth medium selection}
\vspace{-3mm}

The growth medium’s purpose is, as its name suggests, to support a rapid cell growth. Selecting the right medium is essential as it affects the viability and growth rate of cells and consequently the whole process (e.g., production time, initial number of cells needed, etc.). 
The ideal medium should i) mimic the in vivo environment, ii) promote cell proliferation, iii) maintain the cell identity, iv) align with the team’s ethos (environmental-friendly and ethical practices), v) be cost-effective and easily reproducible.
A multi-criteria analysis of several commercially available options is conducted below to choose the optimal medium.
