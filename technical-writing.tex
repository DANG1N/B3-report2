\textbf{MAINLY TALK ABOUT WHY YOUR CHOICE LED TO A BETTER ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DESIGN OBJECTIVES.}\\

The generic structure of a technical report:

1. Introduction: Provide context, motivation, and background information

What is the big-picture problem? Why is it a problem? Who cares?

What have others done to solve the problem? What is still left to do? What did you do?

2. Methods: Explain what you did
Provide enough detail for someone else to reproduce your results.

For each aspect, the level of detail should be commensurate with the level of novelty.

3. Results: Show and explain what you found.
Provide figures and other qualitative and quantitative evidence for your conclusions.

Explain and interpret what you are showing. Not "What does the data look like?", but "What does the data mean?"

4. Discussion: Consider the implications and limitations of your results

5. Conclusions: Connect your results with the original problem.

What have you actually achieved here? What should be done next?\\

Tip 1. Emphasise results, interpretation, and discussion.

Tip 2. Technical writing needs to be precise, concise, objective, careful

Tip 3. Every sentence must: (i) make a point (ii) form a logical link between the previous sentence and the next\\
